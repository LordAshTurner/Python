Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Objective
You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:
Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of this project.

For Python I filtered, cleaned/removed duplicates, data wrangling, aggregation and grouping subset data to look at the patterns and facts within Instacart Grocery Basket, and was able to answer questions some of the following questions.

I created several profiles to help identify Household Income, Age, to determine groups that made more orders than others, or different social economic statuses determiend these profiles.  The following is an example:
