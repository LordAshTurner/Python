    I found an identifier variable in the df_ords dataframe that doesnâ€™t need to be included in the analysis as a numeric variable and changed it to a suitable format.
df_ords['days_since_prior_order'].value_counts(dropna = False)

    I took a variable in the df_ords dataframe with an unintuitive name and changed its name without overwriting the dataframe. 
df_ords.rename(columns = {'order_dow':'orders_day_of_week'},inplace = True)
 df_ords.head()

    I used location method to subset my price ranges for my future results.  Look in my ReadMe for insight on my Python skills.
